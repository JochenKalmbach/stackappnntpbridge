##About

With this NNTP Bridge you can follow all posts of StackOverflow (and other StackExchange sited) very easily. Each question will be shown as one thread with all tags, the comments, answers and comments to this answers.
It might help to get a better overview of all threads withing a specific tag. Also it might help if you are used to newsgroups.
This application works as an NNTP-Server which provides the posts to any newsreader.
Currently it provides only **read-only** access to the posts. Later it is planned to implement some write access.
